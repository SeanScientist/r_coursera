This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

*Week 1: 
getwd()   = view working directory
dir()  = list of files and folders
setwd("~/GitHub/r_coursera")   = sets the working directory, but this does NOT save the working directory for future instances of Rstudio. Must be reset every time I open Rstudio

myfunction <- function(){}
rnorm(100)  selects random 100 numbers from normal distribution and returns array
mean(x)  calculates the mean of an array. x must be an array or a list.
